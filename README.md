The repository shows the compiler (simulator) of the Little Man Computer, which also contains some programs in the LMC
programming language for implementing different functions.

## About Little Man Computer

The Little Man Computer (LMC) is an instructional model of a computer, created by Dr. Stuart Madnick in 1965. The LMC
is generally used to teach students because it models a simple von Neumann architecture computerâ€”which has all the
basic features of a modern computer. It can be programmed in machine code (albeit in decimal rather than binary) or
assembly code.
